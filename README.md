# archinstaller
Just a place for my installer scripts.

Came from me having to reinstall a system over and over after screwing something up.

Designed to work on a Dell XPS 13 9360 (aka kunkun).

Takes some pointers from https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS but ultimately this is designed so I make my own solutions.

## Basic Features
* Full Luks LVM2 Disk Encryption - only for theft deterrent: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability
